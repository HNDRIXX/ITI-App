* Process Flow

// Project Planning and Requirements Gathering:
- Define the goals and objectives in HRDotNet Mobile Application.
- Identify the specific features and functionalities that needed to include.

// Designing:
- Creating prototype or mockup for the mobile application's user interface using tools like Figma.
- Designing the mobile application's layout, navigation, imagery and user experience.

// Set Up the Development Environment:
- Install Node.JS and npm (Node Package Manager) needed to use.
- Install packages that needed to use (react-native-gestures, expo-images, expo-calendar, etc.)

// Frontend Development (React Native):
- Develop the HRDotNet's frontend using React Native components.
- Implement navigation like bottom navigation using React Navigtion.
- Incorporate UI/UX designs from prototype or mockup.

// Backend Development (React Native):
- Choose a backend technology stack (Node.js, Express).
- Set up a server to handle data storage and logic.
- Implement APIs for communication between the frontend and backend.

// Database Integration:
- Select and set up a database (if needed).
- Create database schemas to store the data features (if needed).

// Testing:
- Perform unit testing, integration testing and end-to-end testing.
- Test on funcionalities and features.
- Test on various devices and screen size to ensure compatibility.

// Compliance: 
- Regularyly update dependencies and libraries to patch the harm vulnerabilities.

// Maintenance and Updates:
- Continously improve the app based on user feedback.
- Release updates with new features and bug fixes.

// User Support 
- Provide training and support to the users like HR staff and end-users.


* API Development

- API (Application Programming Interface) development in an HRDotNet mobile application is the process of designing and building the set of rules and protocols that enable the mobile app to interact with the backend server and access HR related data and functionalities. 

This essential component serves as the bridge and connection that allows HR professionals, employees, and administrators to efficiently manage HR processes and access critical information on their mobile devices.


* Mobile Specific Discussion

Geofencing

- The Geofencing feature in HRDotNet Mobile Application is a location-based positioning that enables organizations to define virtual boundaries or zones around specific physical locations, such as offices, venues, or project areas. It serve as a monitor and manage employee attendance and track work hours.

Key Aspects in Geofence:

1. Setting Geofences: HR administrators can use the HRDotNet mobile application to create geofences around designated work locations. These geofences are typically defined by latitude and longitude coordinates and can vary in size, from a small building to an entire campus.

2. Time-In/Time-Out: With the Geofencing feature enabled, employees are required to check in when they enter a geofenced area and check out when they leave.

3. Real-time Location Tracking: Geofencing technology continuously tracks the real-time location of employees within the defined geofences. This tracking can be background location tracking.

4. Attendance Monitoring: Geofencing is used to monitor employee attendance automatically. When an employee enters or exits a geofenced area, the system records their time of arrival or departure, providing accurate attendance data.

5. Work Hour Tracking: In addition to attendance, Geofencing can be used to track work hours.

* Discussion
// Architecture
- The HRDotNet Mobile Application just needed to be consume the data response of HRDotNet Web.
- Architecture will be in React Native.
- Architecture will focus in creating services for API Call

// Programming Language
- React Native

// Task/Work Assigned
- Frontend (Patrick)
- Backend (Sir Jess)

// Operation
- Fetching, Updating and Saving.
- Validation of user inputs.

// API
- Creating the API from scratch.
- API will be establish in end to end point between frontend and backend development.

// Features
- Features will be discuss when the mobile application design is finalized.
